## User Stories

### MVP

- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to see all the plants in the database, so that I can view all the plant options.
- As a user, I want to be able to view plants by descriptive categories, so that I can narrow my search to types of plants I'm interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to update a plant in the database, so that I can add that plant to my favorites list for future reference.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a plant for the database, so that I can see a more broad range of plant options to choose from.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to individual plants from the database, and view more detailed information about them.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a plant from the database, so that I can customize my plant search based on preference.
- As a user, I want my web app to use React, so that the site is more streamlined, and doesn't reload with each new navigation.
- As a user, I want my navigation bar to utilize react router, so that the site navigates to each category seamlessly from the home page.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to be noted in the system as a User, so that my plants and favorites are saved to my login.
- As a user, I want to have restrictions on what plants I can delete or edit, so that the main database stays accurate.
- As a user, I want to be able to use a search bar to find relevant results, so that I don't have to use a nav bar.

### Major Hurdles

Our biggest hurdle was time! We had so many ideas for how we wanted this app to perform and function. With more time, like anything, we would have been able to incorporate more features.
One hurdle we did encounter involved our "favoriting" functionality. The user experience of favoriting a plant was incorporating an update to our API. Incorporating that real-time change with the flashing of the heart from grey to red, or red to grey, was a feat!
No matter what the issue though, each problem was tackled as a team, and our favorite button works wonderfully ;).
